This module paves a path to introduction with GitHub  as it includes setting up an account , creating repositories , cloning them and branching of the master branch in a given repository to work individually on the exisiting code in the master branch . The assignment requires resolving conflicts at both the ends remotely and locally . The first situation arises when one of the persons (P2) tries to merge the code from his branch to master branch , unaware of the changes that another person (P1) has already made to the master branch . This often occurs when since a person hasnâ€™t updated or pulled from new code in the master branch. The second situation arises when a person (P1) is trying to pull code from master branch to his branch on his own setup (or local computer ) unaware of the fact that the code in master branch is new or updated code by another person (P2).

## Significance of this Lab

In actual software development, there are many instances where one needs to branch off the main branch and work i.e. code or develop new features ,test them and then push them up to the main branch and the testing part might require troubleshooting and solving conflicts multiple times until the new code at your branch can be merged successfully into the master branch.



## Installation
